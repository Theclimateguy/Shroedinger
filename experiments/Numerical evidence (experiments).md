## Numerical evidence (experiments)

This section summarizes a sequence of numerical “toy” experiments designed to validate the core consistency requirement of the Hilbert‑bundle/RG framework: **a well-defined, gauge-covariant balance law on the extended base $(t,x,\mu)$**, where apparent nonconservation on a fixed scale $\mu$ is accounted for by a vertical (RG) flux term.  In open-system language, the point is to avoid spurious violations of continuity laws that can arise when the reduced dynamics is inconsistent with the corresponding current operator; such issues are known even for Lindblad-type master equations if approximations break the operator-current conservation structure.[^1][^2]

### Setup: base, fibers, and gauge geometry

We discretize the base as a lattice $(x,k)$ with $x$ a physical space coordinate (1D chain, periodic or open) and $k$ a discrete scale index (RG layer).  The fiber is a Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{x,k}$, and states are represented either (i) as sitewise density matrices $\rho(x,k)\in\mathrm{End}(\mathbb C^2)$ for geometry-only tests, or (ii) as many-body chain states inside each $\mu$-layer for continuity/balance tests.  Gauge geometry is implemented by link variables $U_x(x,k),U_\mu(x,k)\in U(2)$ (in practice $SU(2)\subset U(2)$ to reduce parameters) and plaquettes[^2]

$$
P_{x\mu}(x,k)=U_x(x,k)\,U_\mu(x+1,k)\,U_x^\dagger(x,k+1)\,U_\mu^\dagger(x,k),
$$

with a Hermitian “physical curvature”

$$
F_{x\mu}^{\rm phys}=\frac{P_{x\mu}-P_{x\mu}^\dagger}{2i}.
$$

This construction is manifestly gauge-covariant under local conjugation.[^2]

### Experiment A: gauge invariance and noncommutativity diagnostics

We verified that in the noncommutative regime neighboring vertical links do not commute (measured by $\|[U_\mu(x,k),U_\mu(x,k+1)]\|$, which is generically nonzero in the sampled configurations). [^2] We also tested gauge invariance of the scalar $\Lambda(x,k)=\mathrm{Re\,Tr}(F^{\rm phys}_{x\mu}(x,k)\rho(x,k))$ by applying random local $g(x,k)\in SU(2)$ and transforming $F\to gFg^{-1}$, $\rho\to g\rho g^{-1}$; $\Lambda$ remained unchanged to machine precision in our checks. [^2] This establishes that $\Lambda$ is a legitimate gauge-invariant “matter–geometry” observable (though not necessarily a universal source term). [^2]

### Experiment B: $x$-local dissipation and spatial continuity (no explicit $\mu$)

To ensure the meaning of “local conservation” in physical space, we tested a 1D spin chain with local Hamiltonian densities $h_i$ (bond energies) and the standard lattice energy current operator $j_i$ built from commutators of neighboring bond terms.  With a strictly $x$-local dissipator (sitewise dephasing), we numerically confirmed the discrete balance form[^2]

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle h_i\rangle + \big(\langle j_i\rangle-\langle j_{i-1}\rangle\big)= \langle \text{dissipative source at }i\rangle,
$$

with residuals consistent with numerical precision.  This step isolates the spatial part of the continuity structure before introducing scale flow.[^2]

### Experiment C: entropy growth does not fix energy conservation

We demonstrated on minimal examples that entropy increase under coarse graining does not, by itself, imply conservation (or nonconservation) of a chosen “energy”: dephasing can conserve $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho K)$ if it is aligned with the eigenbasis of $K$, but generically changes $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho K)$ if misaligned.  This supports the conceptual choice to treat scale flow as an open, generally dissipative process and to formulate conservation as a **balance law with sources/fluxes**, rather than enforcing strict layerwise invariance.[^3][^2]

### Experiment D: full balance on $(t,x,\mu)$ via a direct-sum $\mu$-Hilbert space

To test the *full* balance structure, we modeled $\mu$-layers as a direct sum Hilbert space

$$
\mathcal H_{\rm tot}=\bigoplus_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathcal H_{\rm chain},
$$

so that probability/weight can flow between layers via vertical jump operators.  The time evolution is generated by a Lindblad equation with three parts: (i) unitary dynamics within each $\mu$-layer (block-diagonal $H$), (ii) $x$-local dissipation within layers (sitewise dephasing), and (iii) vertical ($\mu$) jumps $k\to k+1$ implementing a noncommutative parallel transport (via a chain unitary built from $U_\mu(x,k)$).  For bond-energy observables $h_b$ in each layer, we verified numerically that[^2]

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle h_b\rangle_k + \mathrm{div}_x \langle j\rangle_k
= \underbrace{\mathrm{Tr}(h_b\,\mathcal D_{\rm deph}[\rho])}_{\text{\(x\)-dissipation}}
+ \underbrace{\mathrm{Tr}(h_b\,\mathcal D_{\mu}[\rho])}_{\text{vertical RG flux/source}},
$$

with residuals at machine precision across the sampled instances.  This is the central “completeness” check: what looks like nonconservation on a fixed $\mu$-slice is exactly accounted for by a vertical term defined by the same generator.[^2]

### Experiment E: coherence-driven vertical rates and the role of $\Lambda$

We then constrained the vertical flow rate $\eta_k$ to depend **only on local coherence** (empirical hypothesis), keeping the vertical operator structure otherwise fixed, and tested whether $\Lambda$-like gauge scalars improve the empirical prediction of the vertical source term $|\mathrm{Tr}(h_b\mathcal D_\mu[\rho])|$. [^2] In this regime, coherence-based features predict the vertical source better than $|\Lambda|$, consistent with the fact that $\eta_k$ was chosen as a function of coherence and not of curvature. [^2] This supports the interpretation that $\Lambda_{\rm matter}$ should not be assumed a universal source by default; additional RG “angular velocity”/connection structure can contribute independently, as you anticipated. [^2]

### Experiment F: comparing families of vertical operators (same $\eta(\text{coh})$)

Finally, we compared several noncommutative vertical operator families under the same coherence-driven rate rule $\eta(\text{coh})$: (i) pure transport jumps, (ii) transport with pointer projectors extracted from $U_\mu$, and (iii) transport with pointer projectors extracted from $F_{x\mu}$.  In all families, the full $(t,x,\mu)$ balance residual remained at machine precision (continuity closure is robust), while the statistical relationship between coherence features, $\Lambda$-like scalars, and the vertical source term varied across families.  This indicates that **operator design choices** in the vertical sector control what becomes the most informative “matter–geometry” indicator, and suggests a path to learning the effective theory from empirical constraints rather than postulating a unique source functional.[^2]

### Relation to the broader thermodynamic-gravity logic

Conceptually, this organization aligns with non-equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics approaches where a balance relation includes an entropy production term, rather than enforcing equilibrium Clausius equality universally.  In our context, the “vertical” RG flux plays the role of an internal channel that can source apparent nonconservation on a reduced description, and its decay under decoherence is consistent with the emergence of a classical limit on large scales.[^4][^2]
